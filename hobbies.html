        <h2>Video Editing</h2>
        <p> I started editing videos when I was about thirteen. I was self-taught in video editing regarding Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Audition, Adobe Media Encoder, and a bit of both Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I started uploading those videos on Instagram and gained over four thousand followers. The kind of videos I edited were music videos, and shows/movies, sometimes even celebrities.</p>
