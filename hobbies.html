        <h2>Video Editing</h2>
        <p> I started editing videos when I was about thirteen. I was self-taught in video editing regarding Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Audition, Adobe Media Encoder, and a bit of both Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I started uploading those videos on Instagram and gained over four thousand followers. The kind of videos I edited were music videos, and shows/movies, sometimes even celebrities.</p>

        <h2>Skateboarding</h2>
        <p>Skateboarding has always been one of my dreams as a little kid. Growing up, I wasn’t allowed to own or ride one because my parents feared that I might get severely hurt. In exchange, I requested a bike and scooter, and I’ve loved them since. Recently, I had saved enough money to buy a starter board. It is an Element board with the standard wheels, and it was hard to ride on at first because of the sensitive wheels and not being able to find a flat enough surface. But eventually, I got the hang of it and was able to buy a standard board, which is my Girl board with softer wheels for the main purpose of travelling. </p>

        <h2>Instruments: Violinist & Guitarist</h2>
        <p>I’ve had five years of experience with the violin, starting from when I was learning in fifth grade during school. I’ve always loved string instruments and the way you can manipulate them around anyway you want to create a specific sound. A fun fact about violins is that it is the closest instrument you can get to a human singing voice. The guitar is an instrument I started learning a year ago. I currently own a Fender Stratocaster, which I’ve been advised is a great starter guitar. I’ve been able to play songs such as TV by Billie Eilish.</p>

        <h2>Reading & Drawing</h2>
        <p>I’ve combined these two into one because I’ve always had a knack for drawing when I was younger. I used to create really cool projects that eventually got to be displayed in showcases in school. I haven’t been able to draw in what seems like years, so I have recently been trying to get back into it. I was motivated by the manga and books I’ve read when I saw characters and scenes that were drawn in such great detail, and I wanted to recreate my own things.</p>
